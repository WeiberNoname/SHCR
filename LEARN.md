* ##### My opinion is to use the static C++ openCV library to introduce the framework of openCV(display the image and video), and use the C++ dynamic openCV library to achieve a specific task that will not be required by the runtime process(helps the special image processing function), and introduce the C static library to enhance a specific algorithm calculation that help achieve python AI model, and use C dynamic library to achieve my own design algorithm calculation that may be used after runtime process.
